Hello! I'm a recent grad from Smith College with a BA in Statistics and Data Science and a minor in Psychology. My time at Smith has taught me a lot about being critical and investigative about every data set I look at. I continuously advancing my technical and communication skills by taking my learning into my own hands while also learning from those around me. 

With proficiency in data analysis tools such as R and Python, I have honed my ability to extract insights from large data sets. My strong communication skills also enable me to clearly and effectively present findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
